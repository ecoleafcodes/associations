## Materials and Methods - Species Association Calculation

To assess the associations between species, we calculated pairwise species associations across multiple plots and censuses using a combination of relative basal area and relative abundance data. The analysis aimed to quantify how similarly two species behaved in terms of their spatial distribution and abundance patterns.

For each pair of species, we evaluated their association by analyzing their relative abundances across different census periods within the same plot. The relative basal area and abundance values were used as indicators of each species' presence and ecological role in the community. The association score for each species pair within a plot was computed by taking the dot product of their relative abundance or basal area vectors across the census periods. This mathematical operation effectively measured the similarity in their distribution patterns. The resulting association scores were normalized by the number of census periods to ensure comparability across different plots.

Finally, the association scores were summed across all plots to generate a comprehensive measure of species association, encompassing strength (multiplication part) and frequency (addition across plots). The output of this analysis is a dataset that provides pairwise association scores for all species combinations.
